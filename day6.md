 # VINYL CUTTING 
 
 
 A vinyl cutter is a type of computer-controlled machine. Small vinyl cutters look like computer printers. 
 The computer controls the movement of a sharp blade. This blade is used to cut out shapes and letters from sheets
  of thin self-adhesive plastic (vinyl).Create your design using any software of your choice or choose one from any
 browser and open the file using the CutShop software. The image must be preferably gray scale to get the accurate design. 
 Right click and select trace the image outline. Change the settings as required and press enter key. Now you can adjust 
 the size of vinyl to be used : Right click on the image and select Properties. ( The size is in mm .) Your design is ready 
 to be cut.

Load the sample piece of vinyl into the machine. On the left side in the front and back are two LED ‘eyes’. These are infared 
emitters and receivers which sense the presence of the vinyl. You have to position the vinyl so that it will cover these sensors.
You also have to position the pressure rollers over the vinyl to make sure it will be able to handle the material. On the panel above
the rollers, there are several white lines. The rollers must be positioned on these white lines or the machine wont run. Make sure 
the vinyl is running straight, or it may slip out from under the rollers. Flip the pressure lever to make the rollers press down,
holding the vinyl between the rollers and the pressure bar.

### CHECKING IN THE DISPLAY

 It shoulde say Sheer unloaded intil you engage the pressure roller. Then you will need to use the down arrow to tell the 
 machine you have loaded a piece or a roll. If you choose piece, the cutter head will move sideways, measure the space between
 the rollers, then it will move the piece out, the back in, then to its original position. This process used the ‘eyes’ to measure
 the height of the piece. you then should be able to see the readout on the display of the pieces measurements.

Press the Cut button on the icon bar. The cutter head should then move side to side and the vinyl should move back and forth.

When the design is cut, you can use the arrow keys to move the vinyl out of the machine.

There is a groove on the front of the machine. Use a razor knife in this groove to cut the piece off.
If there is enough material left, you can leave it in the machine for the next person.
