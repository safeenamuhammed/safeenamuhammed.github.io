## FAB LAB
### WHAT IS A FAB LAB ?
A fab lab (fabrication laboratory) is a small-scale workshop offering (personal) digital fabrication.A fab lab is typically equipped with an array of flexible computer-controlled tools that cover several different length scales and various materials, with the aim to make “almost anything”. This includes technology-enabled products generally perceived as limited to mass production.
Fab Labs are a global network of labs, enabling invention by providing access individuals to tools for digital fabrication, You can use the fab lab to make almost anything (that doesn’t hurt anyone); you must learn to do it yourself, and you must share use of the lab with other uses and users ,Designs and processes developed in fab labs must remain available for individual use although intellectual property can be protected.
### FAB LAB AT MESCE
The Kerala Startup mission is setting up Fab Labs in the state in collaboration with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology Centre of Bits and Atoms. Dr Neil Gershenfeld, director of the MIT Centre for Bits and Atoms pioneered the concept of fab lab.Fab Labs (Fabrication Laboratories) are facilities where people with minimal training can design and manufacture any product using advanced manufacturing machines linked to a computer. Fab Lab at MESCE , Kuttippuram is the only fab lab in the Malabar Zone .It consist of mordern machines such as 3D printer,laser cutter and CNC machines.It provides oppurtunities to make anything.This lab helps any person’s design to get out of paper.
