# LASER CUTTING
 ## WHAT IS LASER CUTTING?
 Laser cutting is a technology that uses a laser to cut materials, and is typically used for industrial manufacturing 
 applications, but is also starting to be used by schools, small businesses, and hobbyists. Laser cutting works by 
 directing the output of a high-power laser most commonly through optics. The laser optics and CNC (computer numerical control)
 are used to direct the material or the laser beam generated. A typical commercial laser for cutting materials would involve a 
 motion control system to follow a CNC or G-code of the pattern to be cut onto the material. The focused laser beam is directed 
 at the material, which then either melts, burns, vaporizes away, or is blown away by a jet of gas,[1] leaving an edge with a 
 high-quality surface finish. Industrial laser cutters are used to cut flat-sheet material as well as structural and piping materials.

 There’s a range of software that can be used with the laser cutter.

Here’s a short list example of software that can be used.

For **raster images**:
Gimp (free software) Gimp Download Information Photoshop (An old but legally free version of Adobe Photoshop can be
downloaded: Adobe Photoshop CS2 )

For **vector images**:
DraftSight AutoCAD Adobe Illustrator Inkscape (free software) Download Options for Inkscape The laser is used with different 
software as if it’s a printer. Different results can be accomplished by adjusting the speed and power of the laser.

Here also we use Rhinocerous software for designing the model.
