# INTRODUCTION TO FAB LAB
“FabLab - MESCE” is digital manufacturing technology, combininig 2D and 3D design with the latest fabrication technology.
Embracing a broad spectrum of methods ranging from CNC machining to 3D printing, and even PCB Milling. It can produce a single 
unique product from a digital design in a matter of minutes- and at a very low cost in comparison to traditional tooling methods.
Our instructor Mr. Jaseel gave us a brief explanation of fablab and the scope of fablab. His words was so impressive that many of
us including me thought of taking fablab as a carrier option. He also explained about the overall works to be done in this 2 week workshop 
and introduced new websites to us and  asked to make our own website.
