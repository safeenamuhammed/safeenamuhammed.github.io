# 3D PRINTING
The term “3D printing” originally referred to a process that deposits a binder material onto a powder bed with inkjet printer 
heads layer by layer. More recently, the term is being used in popular vernacular to encompass a wider variety of additive manufacturing
techniques. United States and global technical standards use the official term additive manufacturing for this broader sense. 
ISO/ASTM52900-15 defines seven categories of AM processes within its meaning: binder jetting, directed energy deposition, material 
extrusion, material jetting, powder bed fusion, sheet lamination and vat photopolymerization

### STEP 1 Preparation of a model for printing

1-Prepare a 3D model and convert it into one of the following formats using any of the available 3D-modelling software (Siemens NX, 
AutoCad, Inventor, Rhino, etc.): .STL .OBJ .DAE. .AMF

2-Load the suitably converted 3D model file into Cura1 via the “Load” button. Adjust the model’s scale and position in a virtual 
space of the Ultimaker 2+ presented in Cura. *If necessary for the construction, don’t forget to utilize “Support Structure”.
Customize the nozzle / material / speed settings in the upper left corner of the Cura Software. Wait for the software to process
the model and the settings. After a while you will get the result with “Time”, “Length of plastic wire”, “Mass of plastic” specified.
If the results are satisfying, proceed with saving. Save the model to the SD-card (from Ultimaker 2+) by pushing button.

### STEP 2 Printing the model in Ultimaker 2+

1-Insert the SD-card with the saved 3D-model from the Cura software (in G-code format) into the slot on the Ultimaker 2+.

2-Using the LCD (display) Check if the material installed corresponds with the specified in the Cura software. Use the following
steps: MATERIAL – SETTINGS

3-If necessary2 , using the LCD level the build-plate with the following steps: MAINTENANCE – BUILD-PLATE …follow the described
on the display procedures.

4-Go to the PRINT section using the LCD. Find your model. Push the button on the disk and start printing3 .


5-Printing takes time. Check your model constantly, and never touch the model or the machine while printing.

6-Detach the printed model from the glass-plate.

7-Clean the printed model from the supports, excesses of the material, etc.
 
## Software Required:

A few software applications were installed which would be useful in the fabrication lab. Some of the softwares that were told to be installed were:

AutoCAD ( Ex. : EagleCAD, Rhinoceros) It is used for creating blueprints for our designs in mind.
Software Required:

Cura It is a 3D printing slicing application. This is the software that is used to turn our design image into a format 
that can be used by the 3D printer to print the corresponding 3D object.
