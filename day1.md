I“FabLab - MESCE” is digital manufacturing technology, combininig 2D and 3D design with the latest fabrication technology. 
Embracing a broad spectrum of methods ranging from CNC machining to 3D printing, and even PCB Milling. It can produce a single 
unique product from a digital design in a matter of minutes- and at a very low cost in comparison to traditional tooling methods.
