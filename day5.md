# ELCTRONICS PRODUCTION AND CNC
In electronics production we designed a simple circuit and constructed its board and schematic file to be milled 
from shopbot and to make a pcb. Circuit consist of two LEDâ€™s controlled by a mini microcontroller and includes resistors
and capacitor to make the circuit long life.
### INTRODUCTION TO EAGLE
Eagle Software ascertains itself as a paramount institution in provid ing software products and solutions for Health Care, 
Micro-Finance, Insurance and Immigration. We develop mobile phone games, online lott ery applications and deliver value added 
services for mobile phone ga mes. We deliver end-to-end solutions for web and desktop applications based on Smart Card / RFID
Solutionstechnology.
### CNC
Computer numerical control (CNC) is the automation of machine tools by means of computers executing pre-programmed sequences
of machine control commands.This is in contrast to machines that are manually controlled by hand wheels or levers, or mechanically
automated by cams alone
### SHOPBOT CNC

CNC stands for computer numerical control. A CNC can be used in the production of many different items, such as printed circuit 
board, door carvings, interior and exterior decorations, wood panels, sign boards, wooden frames, moldings, musical instruments, 
furniture, and so on.

The main component is a board. We use copper boards even though silver boards are better since the latter is expensive. FR-4 board is used in the lab. There are available i 2 sizes.
- 1/32 which is maainly used for cuttting. - 1/64 which is mainly ised for hutching

The software used is EAGLE (Easily Applicable Graphical Layout Editor) , a scriptable electronic design automation application with schematic capture, printed circuit board layout, auto-router and computer-aided manufacturing features.

* The image for PCB Milling is downloaded from FABMODULES. Now image is opened in the software as input in SPB format.

* Now select the output form.

* Next select the process foam rough cut(1/8).
